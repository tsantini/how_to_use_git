## Running a clean fit install of ubuntu (for demonstration purposes, you don't need to run this)

`docker run -it -v ~/:/mnt/home ubuntu:latest`

## Installing git on Ubuntu for example

`apt update` -> installing in a regular computer, you will need to use `sudo apt ...`

`apt install git`

`apt git --version`

## configuring git

`git config --global user.name "Name"` -> any Name you want

`git config --global user.email "user@example.com"` -> this has to be the email linked with your github account

## Generating and copying a ssh key to git website

`ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` -> if this doesn't return any results, run `ssh-keygen -t rsa`, this will generate your ssh key. You can run the command and press enter twice to keep the default cofiguration

`cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

copy the key to your github:

1) open www.github.com

2) click on your profile picure on the top-right corner

3) go to settings -> Ssh and GPG keys -> new SSH key

4) give a name for you key, for example 'home pc' and paste your ssh key on the 'key' field

Now you should be able to pull and push your files without the need of a password 

## Installing text editor for demonstration purposes

`apt install nano`

## Edit a random file you want to iniciate the git

`mkdir test_folder`

`cd test_folder`

`git init`

`nano test.m`

## Create a brand new repository at github website and run this code in the folder of the files of the new repository
`git status`

`git add test.m`

or 

`git add .`

`git commit -m "first commit"`

`git branch -M master`

`git remote add origin git@github.com:tsantini/test.git`

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:tsantini/test.git`

`git push -u origin master`

## Cloning from a existing repository

`git clone git@github.com:tsantini/test.git`

## Editing the existing repository

`nano test.m`

`git diff`

`git add .`

`git commit -m 'adding a new comment to the file'`

`git push`

## Creating a development branch

`nano test.m`

`git status` -> checking the current branch

`git checkout -b development`

`git add .`

`git commit -m 'editing in the development branch'`

`git push`


## Demostration: brancking and pull request in the master from the development branch, asking for revision

## Review of pull request, comments, request of modification, and approval; issue tracker

## Demostration: using the github on matlab

## Demostration: access control and blocking branches for edition

## Forking

## Demostrate: wiki

## Misc useful tools

`.gitignore` -> file that contains the name of the files to the ignored by git, for example `*.o` would ignore all files with `.o` extension

`git mv` -> moves a files

`git rm` -> removes a files

`git pull` -> updates the current repository with the content of the remote repository

`git remote update` -> updates the current repository with the content of the remote repository without automatically merging

`git branch -r` -> list all the branchs in the repository

`git remote show origin` -> shows information about the branches

## Conflicts

when there is a conflict, for example, you modified a piece of code that was also modified remotely, it will show up like this when you do `git pull`:

```
If you have questions, please
